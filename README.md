# OntologyToAPI
This project is an ontology-driven API generator designed to streamline backend development by transforming structured domain knowledge into fully functional APIs. The tool accepts ontologies defined using a set of custom abstract classes, which serve as a semantic blueprint for both metadata and business models.
